# ECE 272 Section 6: Video Graphics Array (VGA)
### 6.1 Background Information
Video Graphics Array (VGA) can be used to display a wide range of resolutions and refresh rates. They draw lines left to right, top to bottom. Each pixel is controlled by 3 analog pins for Red, Green, and Blue (RGB). One common graphics mode is 640x480 at 60Hz. Modern VGA monitors are multi-sync so they are built to work with a range of frequencies. The two other pins that matter for controlling the image are Horizontal Sync and Vertical Sync. When Hysnc goes to 0, the next line starts to draw. When Vysnc goes to 0, it goes back to the top line again, starting a new frame.

6.5 Procedure:
There are 6 steps to digital logic design

Design Process Figure 6.2: Use this process for designing the final project.

Design: The context of the design is established in this step. The context involves defining the inputs, desired outputs, and all the logic required in-between. In this step, all the minimizations and layout are planned for the design entry process. While this step is not always the longest, it should involve the most thought and effort. This typically requires a complete block diagram showing all the logic blocks and the connections between them, often with written explanations of specific functions.
Design Entry: The actual drafting of the digital logic design occurs in this step, translating the design from block diagrams and descriptions into the software. This can be accomplished directly by writing HDL code, or graphically by drawing a schematic that a software tool can convert into HDL code.
Design Simulation: Before committing to hardware, this step tests the design in a controlled computer simulation. If the design does not function as specified in the ”Design” step, it is revised.
Synthesize and Map Design: When the design simulates correctly, the HDL and schematic source files are synthesized into a design file that can be written to the FPGA. This includes assigning the inputs and outputs of the design to IO pins.
Program Hardware: After the design file is created, it is used to configure the FPGA. Quartus Prime sends a bit stream over the USB-B cable to configure the DE10-Lite FPGA.
Test Hardware: Verify hardware operation once the FPGA has been programmed. The FPGA should operate exactly as the design predicted, which was verified by the simulation. Synthesis problems, timing violations, or incorrect assumptions about the hardware can require the designer to return to the ”Design” step.
6.6 Design
You must design a system that generates the Hsync and Vsync signals with the correct timing. Each wave has 4 sections: Sync, back porch, display interval, and front porch (a,b,c,d, respectivly). Sync is the only time that the Hsync or Vsync signal is actually changed. It is driven low, and upon its rising edge the back porch starts. During both the back porch and the front porch, THE RGB VALUES MUST BE 0. Each Hsync makes a new line, each Vsync start the next frame by setting the line back to 0. You must keep track of the number of cycles and lines.

To do this,

Create a 25Mhz clock signal.
Design modules to: Count clock cycles, Generate (H/Z)Sync Signals, and Control the RGB
